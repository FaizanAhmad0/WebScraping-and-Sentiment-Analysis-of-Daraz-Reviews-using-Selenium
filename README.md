# WebScraping-and-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Daraz-Reviews-using-Selenium


Introducing an advanced program that harnesses the power of Selenium for web scraping on Daraz, a popular online marketplace. 
This program enables you to extract reviews from three pages of a specific product and perform sentiment analysis using the VADER sentiment analysis tool. Additionally, it allows you to scrape reviews based on a keyword search and explore random products associated with that keyword.

The program begins by utilizing Selenium, a powerful web automation tool, to navigate to Daraz and scrape reviews from three pages of a selected product. It collects the textual data, including customer reviews and ratings, essential for sentiment analysis.

Next, the program employs the VADER sentiment analysis tool to analyze the sentiment expressed in the scraped reviews. VADER, which stands for Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner, provides a pre-trained model for sentiment analysis specifically designed for social media text. By applying VADER, the program determines the sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of each review, allowing for deeper insights into customer opinions and feedback.

Furthermore, the program extends its functionality by allowing you to scrape reviews based on a keyword entered in the search bar. It performs a search using the specified keyword and randomly selects a product related to the search query. It then proceeds to extract reviews from the selected product, enabling you to explore a diverse range of customer opinions.

Through the seamless integration of web scraping, sentiment analysis, and keyword-based review extraction, this program empowers you to delve into the vast world of Daraz reviews. Uncover valuable insights, analyze sentiment patterns, and gain a comprehensive understanding of customer sentiment towards products on Daraz.
